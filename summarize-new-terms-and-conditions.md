A second hand app I am using [changed their T&C to a 12K+ words doc in German](https://www.vinted.de/terms_and_conditions).

```
2 - The terms and conditions state that the platform is not for use by people under the age of 18, that VINTED is not responsible for transactions between users, and that VINTED may make changes to the terms and conditions at any time.
```
```
3 - The following are not allowed to be offered on the platform:
- items that do not follow the catalog rules
- items that the seller is not authorized to sell
- items that are counterfeit or unsafe
- items that violate local, national, or international laws

The seller may offer services to improve the visibility of their items on the platform for an additional fee. VINTED is not responsible for monitoring or actively searching for illegal content on the platform.
```
```
4 - The buyer agrees to pay for the item, and the seller agrees to transfer ownership of the item.
-The VINTED Buyer Protection applies automatically to every purchase made through the "Buy Now" button.
-The VINTED Tracking System only shows the information provided by the shipping service. VINTED is not responsible if the Integrated Shipping Service provides inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated information. 
```
```
5 - The VINTED buyer protection plan offers buyers protection in the form of refunds for lost or damaged items, as well as support from the VINTED customer service team. There is also a fee for this service, which is calculated based on the total price of the transaction. This service does not replace any legal rights or guarantees that buyers may have.
The VINTED buyer protection policy covers buyers who do not receive their item or if the item is damaged during shipping. If a problem arises, the buyer has 2 days to report the issue to VINTED. If the buyer does not report the issue within that time frame, the transaction will go through and the buyer will not be refunded.
If an item is significantly different than described, the buyer is entitled to a refund. If the item is a counterfeit, the buyer is also entitled to a refund. Otherwise, the buyer is not entitled to a refund.
```
```
6 - The gist of these T&C is that the payment for an item will be processed by a third-party payment service, and that the buyer and seller are each responsible for providing accurate information regarding their credit or debit card or other payment method. Additionally, the payment will be held in a trust account by the payment service until the transaction is completed, at which point the funds will be released to the seller. Lastly, these T&C state that the integrated payment system may only be used for transactions involving items on the platform, and not for other products or services.

2. Users are not allowed to collect, store, share or otherwise distribute any data that could be used illegally or that would violate the rights of other users.

2. A user's account may be blocked or limited if the user violates these terms and conditions, or if Vinted has reason to believe that the user has committed fraud or otherwise misused the platform.
3. If Vinted decides to block or limit a user's account, the user will be notified in writing, unless doing so would violate applicable law or otherwise expose Vinted to liability.
```

```
13 -

```

```
14 + 15 -
1. The terms and conditions outline what personal data VINTED collects from the user, and the purpose for which VINTED processes this data. The terms and conditions do not form part of the contract and are not binding.
2. The user is entitled to terminate their contractual relationship with VINTED at any time, but must fulfil all obligations arising from transactions completed before the termination of their relationship with VINTED.
3. If VINTED transfers or assigns its rights and obligations under these terms and conditions to a third party, the user is entitled to terminate their contractual relationship with VINTED immediately.
```

Full disclosure:
I have no connection to this app other than being a user. I did get frustrated with it more than once, tried tweeting, emailing, etc - no response. So can't say I am warmly recommending it because of the user experience, but I do recommend second hand in general.
